# LangSmith

LangSmith is a framework-agnostic platform for building, debugging, and deploying AI agents and LLM applications. Trace requests, evaluate outputs, test prompts, and manage deployments all in one place at [smith.langchain.com](https://smith.langchain.com).

## When to use

Use LangSmith when you need to:
- **Trace and debug** LLM calls, agent steps, retrieval, and tool use
- **Evaluate** LLM outputs with automated or human-in-the-loop scoring
- **Engineer prompts** with a visual playground and version control
- **Deploy agents** to production with the LangGraph-based agent server
- **Monitor** production systems with dashboards, alerts, and cost tracking

## When NOT to use

- To build agent logic or LLM pipelines, use [LangChain](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/langchain/overview), [LangGraph](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/langgraph/overview), or [Deep Agents](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/deepagents/overview) instead
- LangSmith is the **platform layer** that complements these frameworks

## Quick setup

Set two environment variables to enable tracing from any supported framework:

```bash
export LANGSMITH_TRACING=true
export LANGSMITH_API_KEY="your-api-key"  # from smith.langchain.com/settings
```

### Install the SDK

```bash
# Python
pip install langsmith

# JavaScript/TypeScript
npm install langsmith
```

### Verify tracing

```python
from langsmith import traceable

@traceable
def my_function(query: str) -> str:
    # Your LLM logic here—all calls inside are traced automatically
    return "result"
```

## Core capabilities

| Capability | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Observability | Trace every step of your LLM app with automatic or manual instrumentation |
| Evaluation | Run evaluations with code, LLM-as-judge, or composite evaluators |
| Prompt engineering | Create, version, and test prompts in a visual playground |
| Agent deployment | Deploy LangGraph agents with streaming, human-in-the-loop, and durable execution |
| Monitoring | Dashboards, alerts, and cost tracking for production workloads |
